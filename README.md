# Users

This repository contains the Users React + TypeScript application created to administer user data and authentication developed in React using React Hooks.


# .env

When installing, copy and rename the .env.sample file to .env. That file contains all the variables that can be used while developing the application locally. Any variable that starts with "VITE_" will be copied to the production React build and available/used in the application. There are some variables that aren't commented out in this file that are needed in the application for the React application to function properly.
